# Integrate with pyecharts

## Dependencies

`node.js` is required and can be installed from [its website](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
I would recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)ï¼Œbecause switching in between different versions are made effortless.

With node.js installed, you will need to install [echarts-mapmaker](../tools/mapmaker.md)

## Prepare a js file

`makejs` comes from `echarts-mapmaker`. It can do UTF-8 encoding on the geojson
and write out to a js file. It is expected that UTF-8 encoding will reduce
file size.

```
makejs The-Forbidden-City.geojson The-Forbidden-City.js "The Forbidden City"
```

## Create a custom registry

```
{
    "JS_FOLDER": "/",
    "PINYIN_MAP": {},
    "FILE_MAP": {
         "The Forbidden City": "The-Forbidden-City"
    }
}
```

## Host it locally

```
$ python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

You should be able to access [http://127.0.0.1:8000/registry.json](http://127.0.0.1:8000/registry.json])
